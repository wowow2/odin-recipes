# Odin-Recipes-Project
**Date**: January 3rd, 2023

**Description**: This is a repository designed to house the Recipies project on TOP.

**Skills needed**: Will need to demonstrate skill with HTML, more specifically with the concept of a head/body, the various ways to display information
as in headings, paragraphs, ordered lists, unordered lists, and images. Also will be using the ability to link various pages with each other, both within the
website as well as external links.

**Update**: Finished the HTML component of the project, did a good applying the basics of HTML. Used <h>,<p>,<ul>,<ol>,<head>,<body> tags effectively.
 However, the project is worth a revist in the future as webpage is rather bland, and it could use CSS so that it has some more flair.
